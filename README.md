# MovieMoose

A React app that lets you search movie's based on third party api <a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies">TMDB</a> and save them to a watchlist.

## Instructions
It's as easy as typing into the search bar for a movie, selecting which one you would like to add, and seeing it in the watchlist tab!

## Future additions

For future additions I would like to add a detail page after clicking on a movie to show the descriptions of the movie as well as other info using another react component.

## Current Issue's 

Some movies have a release date of an empty string causing an error when mapping and using substring for the first 4 digits. 

## Additional info

For more information I reference my <a href="https://github.com/JahnoelRondon/MovieMoose/blob/main/notes">notes</a> file in the root directory of the project for learning as well as psuedo code around the files describing code.
